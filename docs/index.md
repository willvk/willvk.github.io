## [[Valkair]]

Valkair is my Norse-inspired Homebrew world for Pathfinder2e, we are right in the middle of our campaign at the moment and you will find lots of session planning, information on the world and lore.

## [[Blog]]

Sometimes I like to publish my thoughts about what I'm working on. I work for Pepperstone which is a global Fintech, but any of my posts
are representative of my own opinions and experiences only and do not represent the company.
