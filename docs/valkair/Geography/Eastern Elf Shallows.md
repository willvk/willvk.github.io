The Eastern Elf Shallows is a place of silent suffering and lingering ghosts. The air is thick with the scent of decay and unwashed bodies, the streets uneven and cracked, lined with the skeletal remains of half-collapsed homes. Elves with hollow cheeks and sunken eyes move through the district like specters, draped in rags that barely shield them from the elements. Some huddle together for warmth, while others sit in the filth, staring vacantly into the distance, too weak to even beg.

### The Lamenting Bell

A crumbling bell tower where elves gather to mourn their ancestors. The bell, when rung, is said to reveal the restless spirits of wronged elves.
A crumbling bell tower rises above the district, its foundation sinking into the rot beneath. The once-grand structure is now little more than a skeletal ruin, its bell rusted but still intact. When the wind blows, it groans in protest, as if carrying the voices of the elves who gather there to mourn. Some claim that when the bell is rung, the wronged dead stir, their restless spirits whispering curses upon the living. No one lingers when that sound echoes through the district.

Hooks - . **The Bell Toll at Midnight** – An unknown figure has rung the Lamenting Bell at midnight for three nights in a row. Now, ghosts have begun appearing, seeking justice for past crimes.

### Ancient Elven Tomb

Beyond the bell tower lies the **Ancient Elven Tomb**, a gaping wound in the earth, its jagged maw swallowing what little light dares to touch it. The elves whisper that it was once a sacred place, but now it is nothing but a doorway to the forgotten dead. Strange, curling carvings mar the stone at its entrance, depictions of forsaken gods with eyes that seem to follow those who dare to look too closely. No one who enters ever returns, but sometimes, in the dead of night, muffled cries and scraping sounds rise from the depths.

### The Distribution Center

Near the outskirts, a pitiful wooden stall stands under the watchful eyes of orcish guards—the so-called **distribution center**. Here, the elves are given just enough food to prolong their suffering, never enough to quell their hunger. The orcs despise this duty, their contempt plain in every snarl and shove as they toss scraps to outstretched hands. The stall is as much a place of cruelty as it is of sustenance.
