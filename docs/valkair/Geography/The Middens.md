### Nilfheim Gate
The only known passage into the Spine of the World. It is a winding icy trail into the mountains which suffers no ordinary man. It is said the world ends at the Spine and that one will simply fall forever through the depths of Hel if they try to cross. Only the dwarves have been known to master passage to the Spine and they hold its secrets still.

### The Spine of the world
The Spine is a towering mountain range which forms a seemingly impenetrable northern border to the Middens. The peaks of the Spine rise so high they nestle and rest among the clouds and some say they pierce into Asguard itself and in so doing protect us from onslaught from the Jotunn.

### [[Hammerfall]]

### Swamps of the Seidhr
Most people avoid the swamps as they are a miserly place of mudflats where only those with nothing left to lose dare to tread. Myth speaks of this area being home to numerous tribes of Seidhr, witches of powerful magic who will happily reveal secrets of the threads of fate moments before they sever them and devour you and yours.

### [[Caerdan]]'s Embrace
A giant marbled statue with longsword in one hand and the other outstretched, models the great elf king Caerdan. Is it a welcome to this region or a warning?

### Teeth of Jormungandr
Rapids and rocks that feed on unwary vessels, no vessels have been known to ever complete the voyage southeast through the teeth but legend says beyond is simply the stomach and bowls of the great serpent which stretches forever around Valkair.

### The wriggling seas
so named for the prevalence of Jormungandr's children which lurk beneath the surface and have been known to swallow vessels whole.

### The wilds
The wilds are untamed and untravelled lands which stretch far to the south of The Middens. Their distant shores can only be seen on a clear day from a vantage point across the Wriggling seas.
