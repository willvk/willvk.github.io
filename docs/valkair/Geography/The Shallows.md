A dockside tavern and shrine to Njord, serving sailors, merchants, and travelers. It’s run by **Captain Yarra Thorne**, a retired pirate turned priestess. Legends say Njord spared her from a storm, and she now offers safe passage blessings—for a price.

### **The Hollow Coin** (Richeri)

A high-stakes gambling den run by **"Honest" Jacard Velt**, a former noble-turned-criminal. The rich and poor alike place bets here, but the house always wins. Some say a secret tunnel beneath the den leads directly to Upper Hammerfall.

A crumbling bell tower where elves gather to mourn their ancestors. The bell, when rung, is said to reveal the restless spirits of wronged elves.
