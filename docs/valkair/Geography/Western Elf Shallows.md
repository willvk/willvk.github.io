Slightly higher class of elves, skilled labourers or more valued Elves.

This district has better treated elves but they are still downtrodden and generally hated. There may be some residual elven traditions or shops but they would be usurped and owned by humans or orcs instead, simply run by the elves who may know their secrets. No bastion of elven magic or creativity would be allowed to stand, it would be ridiculed and torn down. No this is a ruined culture, downtrodden and defeated eeking out a pitiful existence. With this context, reconsider the points of interest.

### Points of Interest
### **1. The Hollow Hearth** _(Tavern & Lodging House)_

A crumbling, dimly lit tavern owned by a human landlord, **Jorek "Halfpurse" Brandt**, who gouges his elven tenants for every last coin. Once a grand elven hall, its carvings and murals have been defaced, and its high ceilings are now blackened with soot. The elves who drink here keep their heads low, speaking in whispers, careful not to draw attention to themselves.

**Secrets & Hooks:**

- A group of elves secretly meets in the basement to practice old songs and stories, a quiet rebellion against cultural erasure.
- A bartender, [[Veylith Lorarion]], is suspected of smuggling food and supplies to the poorer elves—but is he truly an ally, or just profiting from their desperation?
- The landlord is rumored to be working with local enforcers, reporting "troublemaker" elves in exchange for coin.

### **2. The Tattered Loom** _(Weaving & Tailor Shop)_

An old textile shop producing fine garments, run by elven laborers but owned by an **Ork overseer, Vrakka the Stitch-Mistress**. The elves inside work tirelessly for miserable wages, weaving intricate patterns they were once proud of—now sold under a human or ork name. Some whisper that the looms still bear the old elven blessings for prosperity, though they bring none to the workers.

**Secrets & Hooks:**

- A desperate elf, **Mirel the Weeper**, has woven hidden symbols of defiance into a noble's commission—if discovered, it could mean brutal repercussions.
- A dying elder claims one of the looms is enchanted and holds the last memory of the weaver who created it.
- The ork overseer is growing suspicious of the workers and is planning to replace them with human apprentices, which would leave many elves starving.

### **3. The Hollow Mill** _(Elven Grain Processing & Arcane Flour Mill)_

A massive, crumbling mill once powered by elegant elven magic but now worn down by time and neglect. The elves who work here are forced to use their arcane knowledge to enhance crop yields and grind grain more efficiently, though they see little benefit themselves. Owned by a wealthy human merchant, **Davin Hargrest**, who profits immensely while keeping the elves barely fed.

**Secrets & Hooks:**

- The elves are secretly sabotaging shipments, making the flour spoil faster—an act of quiet resistance.
- An old arcane mechanism deep in the mill is beginning to fail. If it breaks, it could either devastate production or unleash something far worse.
- The mill contains an ancient elven archive, hidden in a forgotten chamber beneath the grinding stones.

### **4. The Sunken Vaults** _(Elven Subterranean Granaries)_

A series of underground storage chambers, kept magically preserved to prevent grain and other food supplies from spoiling. The tunnels are labyrinthine, known only to the elves who work there. Though it is owned and overseen by an ork warlord named **Gorruk the Fat**, the elves still whisper of the vaults’ original purpose—once sacred chambers designed to sustain their people through famine.

### 5. The Ember Chain (Elven Metalsmithing shop) 
- New human name—cruel nod to the enslaved elven smiths.
- The old elven name is etched in a hidden corner, long defaced. (Thalan’Seren)

**Secrets & Hooks:**

- Some of the older vaults contain ancient elven rations that have remained perfectly preserved for centuries. What else might be hidden in the deepest chambers?
- A desperate group of starving elves is planning a dangerous heist, attempting to steal from the granary that they themselves tend.
- Rumors circulate that one of the vaults is haunted by an elven guardian spirit, unwilling to let go of its old duty.
