## **Mongeet – The Beating Heart of the River Trade**

### _"The tide brings fortune, and the tide takes it away."_ – Common saying in Mongeet

Mongeet, once called _The Fishmonger's Meet_, is the bustling river district of **The Shallows of Hammerfall**. Over time, the name was shortened through common speech, but its essence remains: **trade, toil, and tides**. It is the **lifeblood of commerce**, where boats from the **wider world** unload goods, fishmongers and dockworkers battle for the best catch, and smugglers slink in the shadows.

Mongeet is a place of **constant movement**—the river carries ships and secrets alike, and those who cannot keep up with its flow **drown in its currents**, figuratively or literally.

---

## **Layout & Atmosphere**

Mongeet **hugs the riverbank**, its streets a maze of wooden walkways, **half-flooded alleys**, and piers that stretch into the water like reaching fingers. Buildings are stacked haphazardly, some built on stilts, others dangerously leaning toward the river. The smell of **salt, rotting fish, and spiced rum** fills the air, mixing with the ever-present sound of gulls, creaking timbers, and shouting merchants.

**By Day:**

- Fishmongers gut and sell their catch at crowded markets.
- Cargo is hauled from ships by **dockhands**, many of them half-drowned in sweat and ale.
- Merchants barter for exotic goods brought from across the sea.
- [[The Black Tide Tavern]] is a resting spot for tired sailors, though a brawl or two is never far off.

**By Night:**

- Lanterns cast eerie reflections on the **black waters**, illuminating back-alley deals.
- Smugglers load and unload **contraband** under the watchful eyes of paid-off guards.
- Drunken sailors stumble from taverns, some never making it back to their ships.
- Stories of **the River Wraith** keep the superstitious indoors.

## **Notable Locations**

### [[The Black Tide Tavern]]

A notorious drinking hole and smuggler’s den, built on stilts over the river. The owner, **Varka "Low Tide" Brogg**, runs it with a mix of old pirate wisdom and brute strength.

### **The Salt Market**

A sprawling open-air market that **never fully closes**—even in the dead of night, someone is selling something. It is the best place to buy:

- **Fresh & smoked fish** (some from the deep, best not to ask).
- **Rare goods** smuggled in from distant lands.
- **Alchemy reagents** taken from the river’s depths.
- **Cursed trinkets**—at least, according to their desperate sellers.

### **The Sunken Steps**

A half-submerged staircase at the edge of the docks, visible only during low tide. Locals say it leads to the **drowned ruins of an ancient temple**, but no one who ventures down has returned.

### **The Fisher’s Lament**

A shrine dedicated to **Njord**, where fishermen and sailors pray before voyages. Offerings of **silver coins and fish bones** are placed in the water to ensure safe passage.

### **The Drowned Wharf**

A section of the docks that **collapsed into the river years ago**. Some say it was an accident, others whisper that something **dragged it down**. Now, it is a resting place for those who don't wish to be found—alive or dead.
