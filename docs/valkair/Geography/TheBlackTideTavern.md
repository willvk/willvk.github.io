### **The Black Tide Tavern**

A notorious bar built on stilts over the river in **[[Mongeet]]**, the Black Tide Tavern serves as a haven for sailors, smugglers, and anyone looking to avoid the watchful eyes of the city guard. The building itself leans slightly due to years of water damage, and the scent of salt, fish, and strong ale fills the air. Wooden planks groan beneath heavy boots, and the lanterns flicker with an eerie greenish hue, said to be a sign of the "drowned spirits" that haunt the place. Somewhat unexpectedly however, the food at the Black Tide is quite good and boasts a flavorful food and a range of selections to cater for the most complex palate, which occasionally attracts strange non-local visitors to the tavern.

### **The People of the Black Tide Tavern**

#### **Owner: Varka "Low Tide" Brogg (Half-Orc, Female, Mid-40s)**

A former pirate who lost her ship and most of her crew in a naval ambush, Varka Brogg retired to Mongeet and took over the Black Tide Tavern. With deep scars across her arms and a missing tusk, she commands respect from patrons with her booming voice and iron glare. She allows smugglers to do business as long as they follow her rules: **"No killing, no cheating the house, and no slitting throats where I drink."**

**Secret:** [[Varka-S1|Varka]] 

#### **Cook: Ol’ Mohr (Human, Male, 60s)**

A grizzled former ship captain, Ol’ Mohr is a bearded, one-eyed man with a permanent smell of salt and fish oil. He cooks whatever comes off the boats that morning—whether it's fresh or not. His most infamous dish, **"The Tide's Wrath"**, is a stew that has been rumored to knock out even the toughest sailors.
