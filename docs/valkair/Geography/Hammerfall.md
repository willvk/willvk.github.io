Hammerfall was so named by [[ThePact]] when the city was captured in 2790 BCE from its Elven population. It is a city of unparalleled Elven construction and safety which has stood for as long as anyone can remember. The city is built upon a natural harbour and rock formation which protects it from all sides. In addition to the natural defenses the city was said to be protected by impenetrable magics of the gods.
