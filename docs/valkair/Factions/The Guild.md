[[The Guild]] is predominantly compiled of Norseman but pays no attention to race or creed and as such the Guild is a force unmatched - the power of coin controls the fate of many and The Guild controls the coin. A brutal organisation of individuals, disputes are common but The Guild handles their own disagreements brutally and violently. There is a saying in the Guild, though the face may change, the price does not. This explains the nature of the Guild as the enormity of the organisation is hard to fathom and their power attracts many types; merchant, pirate or mercenary. True power within The Guild is fleeting as wealth and territory changes hands often between its members but to represent The Guilds interests in Hammerfall they have currently appointed [[Yennen]] a fat amiable dwarf from the outer lands. Not much is known about Yennen or what his motivations are in Hammerfall but you can be sure of one thing, a price must always be paid.
