Riven Thermage grew up in an orphanage nestled in [[The Middens]]—a wild, forested stretch just outside the city where nature was as unforgiving as it was beautiful. Life there was a constant struggle for survival, and in that harsh environment, Riven found his only family in three close friends: Liora, whose warm smile and gentle heart could light up even the darkest day; Torran, who was always ready to stand up and protect them; and Etta, smart and resourceful, with a deep fascination for legends—especially those of [[Ullr]], the Norse god of archery, hunting, and winter.

One fateful day, everything changed. The children discovered that their orphanage wasn’t the safe haven they believed it to be—it was a trap, a holding pen designed to break their spirits and prepare them for a life of servitude and slavery. With danger closing in fast, they knew they had to act quickly. In that desperate moment, Etta passed Riven what appeared to be a simple hornbow—an ordinary weapon, unremarkable at first glance. “Take this,” she urged, her eyes shining with both sorrow and fierce determination, “let it protect you, and remember that our sacrifice means hope still exists even in the darkest times.”

No sooner had she spoken than [[Liora]] and [[Torran]] sprang into action. The three of them—Liora, Torran, and [[Etta]]—created diversions to help the others escape, risking everything to distract their captors. Amid the chaos, Riven clutched the hornbow and fled into the shadowy woods of the Middens. However, as he darted between the trees, he found himself nearly cornered by those who pursued him.

Just when it seemed there was no escape, something extraordinary happened. As Riven’s heart pounded and his grip tightened on the hornbow, a surge of crisp, icy energy burst through him. The ordinary weapon transformed before his very eyes, as if Ullr himself had reached down from the frozen heavens to imbue it with divine power. In that silent, awe-filled moment, a soft, ancient voice whispered in Riven’s mind, “I am Winter’s Vigil.”

Awe and renewed strength filled him. With the power of Winter’s Vigil coursing through him, Riven broke free from his pursuers and continued his journey, carrying the memory of his friends. Every clear twang of the bowstring and every echo of the arrow's flight became a reminder of Liora’s kindness, Torran’s courage, and Etta’s unwavering spirit. And though his desperate search for them had failed, Riven held fast to the promise that as long as he had Winter’s Vigil in his hands, he would one day be reunited with his beloved friends.
