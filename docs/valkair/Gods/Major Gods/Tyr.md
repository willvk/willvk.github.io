### **Týr’s Role in Valkair**

Týr is the **god of unwavering resolve**, the **embodiment of honor in battle and law**, and the final arbiter of **oaths and justice**. He is the blade that does not waver, the hand that upholds truth, and the warrior who stands firm even in the face of certain death. In Valkair, where **trust is rare and honor is earned through hardship**, Týr is both revered and feared—his name spoken in solemn oaths, his image carved into the halls of kings, and his justice carried out with steel and blood.

Legends tell of **Týr’s great sacrifice**, when he placed his right hand into the jaws of the **Great Wolf** to bind it with unbreakable chains. Knowing that deceit was the only way to contain the beast, he **gave up his hand in exchange for the world’s safety**, proving that **justice requires sacrifice** and that **a true warrior does not hesitate to give what is necessary for the greater good**.

Týr’s followers believe that **oaths are sacred**—words spoken before gods and men **bind the soul as surely as chains bind the body**. To break an oath is to invite **Týr’s wrath**, and **those who betray their word may find themselves cursed, abandoned, or cast into the darkest corners of history, their names erased from honor and memory.**

Yet, Týr is no simple god of war. He does not revel in slaughter nor favor blind violence. He teaches that battle **must be fought with purpose**—whether to protect, to uphold justice, or to defend the weak. His warriors are **knights, judges, and war-leaders**, those who wield **both sword and law** in equal measure. They do not strike out in wrath but in **measured, righteous fury**, ensuring that the guilty are punished and that **true justice prevails, no matter the cost.**

Though his justice is absolute, his mercy is **not unheard of**. He does not demand **vengeance**, but rather **balance**. A warrior who **admits wrongdoing, pays their debt, and atones** may yet find redemption in Týr’s eyes—but **only if their penance is true and their sacrifice great.**

Týr is **the last stand against chaos**, the **unyielding will of law and duty**, and the **one who bears the weight of justice even when it demands his own blood.**

### **Blessings & Curses**

- **Týr’s Favor:** Those blessed by Týr may find **their blade striking true when enforcing justice**, their **resolve unshaken even in the face of death**, and **their word carrying the weight of divine authority**. They may also **sense dishonesty**, feeling a deep unease when lies are spoken in their presence.
- **Týr’s Wrath:** Oathbreakers and cowards who defy Týr may **find their sword arm weakened**, their **words empty and without weight**, and **their name slowly forgotten by those who once trusted them**. Some claim that **those cursed by Týr bear an invisible wound upon their right hand—a mark of dishonor that never fades.**

Týr does not tolerate **cowards, betrayers, or liars**. His path is **harsh, demanding, and unrelenting**, but for those who **hold fast to their oaths, wield justice with honor, and stand against the forces of chaos**, **his shield will never break, and his blade will never falter.**
