Orks are a formidable and resilient species, characterized by their large, muscular builds and distinctive features. They typically have tough, green or grayish skin, with prominent tusks that protrude from their lower jaws, adding to their imposing appearance. Many Orks wear their hair long, often braided and adorned with beads or ornaments that symbolize their clan or personal achievements. Their clothing is practical, made from furs, leather, and metal, reflecting a rugged lifestyle suited for their harsh environments.

Ork society is organized into tight-knit clans, each governed by a chieftain or leader chosen for their strength and leadership abilities. Honor, loyalty, and strength are highly valued traits, and the bonds of kinship and community are fundamental to their culture. Celebrations of shared victories and achievements are common, with feasting and storytelling serving as vital components of their social life. Oral traditions play an essential role in preserving the history of their people, with bards recounting tales of legendary warriors and heroic deeds.

Combat is a central aspect of Orkish life, with warriors trained from a young age in various forms of combat. They are known for their brute strength and tactical ingenuity in battle, wielding weapons like axes, swords, and bows with great skill. Orks view warfare as a means of achieving honor and glory, believing that those who die bravely in battle are rewarded in Valhalla.

Spirituality is deeply ingrained in Orkish culture, characterized by a profound connection to nature and reverence for ancestral spirits. Central to their beliefs is the worship of powerful deities drawn from a pantheon reminiscent of the Norse gods.

**[[Thor]]**, the god of thunder and war, holds a special place in the hearts of the Orks. They admire his strength and valor in battle, often invoking his name before embarking on raids or significant confrontations. Orkish warriors pray to Thor for courage and protection, believing that his fierce spirit guides them in combat, helping them to achieve glory on the battlefield. Rituals may include offerings of weapons or symbolic tokens, which are believed to honor Thor and earn his favor in the heat of battle.

**[[Freya]]**, the goddess of love, war, and death, is another significant figure in their spiritual practices. Orks honor Freya for her dual nature, recognizing that she embodies both the nurturing aspects of life and the fierce qualities of a warrior. They seek her blessings for both fertility and success in battle, reflecting their understanding of the interconnectedness of creation and destruction. Festivals dedicated to Freya are marked by celebrations of both love and strength, where warriors are honored, and tales of valor are recounted alongside prayers for prosperity and protection.

Shamans serve as spiritual leaders within Orkish communities, conducting rituals that honor both the natural world and their forebears. They engage in ceremonies to commune with the spirits of the land and the ancestors, ensuring that the lessons and stories of the past are preserved. These practices emphasize harmony with the earth and the importance of respecting the cycle of life and death. Orks believe that their ancestors watch over them, guiding their actions and offering protection through the trials of life.

As a species, Orks embody a rich tapestry of values centered around strength, honor, and community. Their fierce warrior spirit, deep-rooted traditions, and profound connection to nature and their ancestors make them a compelling and respected presence in Valkair.
