The Elves were the first children of the gods. Beloved by the gods and given many gifts, the Elves raised up great cities and conquered the wild untamed lands of Valkair by protecting themselves with harnessed magical power and great walls. The Elves were an experiment somewhere between the immortality of the gods and the frailty of the Valkair peoples.

Despite their accomplishments for some reason the Elves have been dwindling of late. Perhaps this is the prevalence of the barbaric races and the interbreeding between them or perhaps the Elves themselves are responsible for their own downfall.

The Elves are a strict class system and selective monarchy where the High King/Queen is selected from the ruling aristocrazy of the noble families, due to their long lifespans the selection of a new ruler is rarely needed.

The Elves suffer no dilution of the elven bloodline and mixing elven blood with any other species is treated as blasphemy against the Gods and one of the highest crimes of Elven society. Any child born of mixed blood is cast out and forfeits all birthrights.

This behavior parallels their treatment of the "barbaric races" which is to only suffer them temporarily in times of trade.
