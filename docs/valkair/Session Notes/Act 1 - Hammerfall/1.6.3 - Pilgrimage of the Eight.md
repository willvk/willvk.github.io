brief session summary, overall

## Opening Monologue
The battle still clings to them—blood, smoke, and the stench of demon flesh. The Chosen lies slain, his body twisted beside the babau’s blackened remains. Their pursuit of the blood elves had led them into the forgotten depths—an ancient tomb sealed by time. There, beneath layers of dust and silence, they uncovered a hidden chamber bearing Hannah’s name… yet her corpse was gone.

Beyond that tomb, a vast door loomed—its surface carved with the likenesses of the Eight. Each god’s symbol once inset with a rune, now hollow and dark. The way forward was barred, and the hunt halted.

Returning to the council brought little peace. Outrage filled the hall when they spoke of the Chosen’s treachery. The Speaker, cold and measured, denied all involvement—calling it the act of a cursed defector, a stain upon their sacred order. This was not the time for further interrogation, haste is needed and you leave your accusations on others to follow through.

But when the heroes described the door, young Veylith Lorarion stepped forth. Her voice trembled with memory as he told of the _Pilgrimage of the Eight_—an elven rite of passage through temples buried beneath the Shallows. Together, these shrines once bound an ancient evil with the power of the gods themselves.

Grukk One-Tusk then revealed his find: two runes discovered when securing the catacombs after investigating the fallen Ork Guard, their faint glow pulsing with divine energy. Proof, perhaps, that the legend is real and more runes may exist.

Now, with purpose renewed, the heroes descend once more. Stone gives way beneath their boots as they follow the spiral down into the earth’s wound in eastern elf shallows. The air grows cold and wet, thick with the scent of age and rot. Somewhere below, the faint sound of water drips—a heartbeat in the dark—as the torchlight catches on ancient carvings that whisper of gods long silent.

The last step fades into shadow. Ahead, the catacombs breathe deeper into the daark.
## Scene 1

### Temple of Frigg
---
*5 room dungeon for a temple of Frigg dungeon. Should have themes of family + fate.*

Room One: 

Ruin of vast hall, fallen columns. Mistletoe overgrown running rampant. Northern alcove contains a mystral orb sitting atop rounded setting. Covered in cobwebs.

Disturbing the cobwebs triggers an encounter with time spiders, baby and adolescent

Room Two: 

The mystral can be activated and resets the dungeon to its former glory. Beautiful columns. Grandeour and beauty, no mistletoe weeds. While they can interact with things they are merely a living memory, snapshot of the past. They cannot be changed or taken. They meet a young spider, beloved of the elves of this place. With remarkable intelligence, it is something of a keper of this place.

Room Three: 

They must use the mystral to return to current time, to obtain the Rune of Frigg from its inlay in the floor of the main room.

Room Four: 

Fight the Weaver (spider boss, with limited premonition capabilities)

Room Five: 

With enemies defeated the PCs are able to uncover and take the Rune of Frigg,

## Session Notes

Mild lore dump: The weaver was abandoned by the Thrandurassil elves when the Blood Elves attacked and tore the temple to pieces. They fled and left her alone, she had to hide and fend for herself when the monsters came. She survived by manipulating her limited prescience and temporary planar control. She blames the elves for abandoning her and forcing her to become this brutal hateful beast.

When they activated the mystral they ran out and found the waters pure and beautiful blue with a large temple to njord accessible by a footbridge. They found a circular passage to the other temple, is now sealed with the jaws motif.
