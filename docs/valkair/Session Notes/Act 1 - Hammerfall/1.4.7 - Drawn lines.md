## Opening Monologue
*The hill is yours—but it did not come cheap.*

*Last session, you seized a key defensive position, using wit and courage to tip the scales. The sentinel horns sang across the Shallows, luring Pact skirmishers away with echoes of false threats. It bought you just enough—just enough to charge the hill and break the line.*

*The clash was brutal. The Pact’s soldiers fought with discipline and relentless force. For a moment, it seemed you might fall. But you held. Blade met shield, rune met steel—and in the end, you stood victorious.*

*Your triumph allowed dozens more of your people to flee the slaughter, slipping past the Pact’s tightening grip and joining the growing sanctuary behind elven lines. Hope flickers. Whispers of resistance stir through the alleys and granaries like wind before a storm.*

*But the war does not wait.*

*Even now, the Pact pushes deeper into the Shallows, their warriors marching with cold purpose. For every hill you take, two more are threatened. Their numbers seem endless. Their will, unbending.*

*Victory bought time—but not safety.*

*And now, the question once again stands before you:*

***Where will you strike next?***
## H6 - Elven Ghetto
H6 - Stealth mission. Assassinate the Commanders. -> 
Story: Elves use the catacombs to secret the PCs behind enemy lines. To the command tent. They need to kill the three commanders inside before runners to the Pact can return with reinforcements. Commanders are prideful and underestimate the PCs, they will not run or retreat. 
### Chain of command
---
_The Shallows here is littered with broken buildings and the squalor of the Elven ghetto. Simple tents and sheets hung between buildings and rock litter the ground here. The Pact have worked quickly and cleared most of the refuse creating paths large enough to move their forces. They now hold entrenched positions here with a large number of their forces awaiting dispatch further into the Shallows. These forces are silo'ed and disparate, the historical division of race and clan present here within the larger assembled force as well. Three divisions to be exact, with their commanding officer's tent pitched centrally, large and respective of their rank. Controlling this force would be almost impossible without the quorum of these uniting commanders..._
