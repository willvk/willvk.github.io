warehouse fighting
## Opening Monologue
This section is read immediately after one of the session introduction sections. It lays out 3 simple things;

*Night has fallen over Hammerfall, the air thick with the scent of damp wood and grain from the warehouses that loom like silent sentinels along the docks. The Uzzikh warehouse stands among them—dark, cold, and hollow, its only signs of life the distant creak of shifting beams and the scurrying of rats through the rafters.*

*You think the Uzzikh are here to find **Rashan**, a missing ork. She is the first disappearance that has stirred concern, the first name spoken with urgency. But as you have learned, the elves have been vanishing for far longer—dragged from their homes, interrogated, discarded. No one cared, not until now.*

*And now, the Uzzikh are taking drastic action. They have begun taking elves of their own, shaking them down for answers they do not have, looking for a trail that has long gone cold. This is what must have happened to your contact Veylith Lorarion.*

*But this is not just about Rashan. **Loki’s Hand** has their own stake in this. Their elven contact, Veylith, needs to be back on the street, alive and unseen. That means handling this **quietly**.*

*As the last light fades beyond the city walls, the stillness of the warehouse presses in. The weight of unsolved disappearances, unanswered questions, and unseen eyes lingers in the air. **You stand on the edge of something deeper than just one missing ork.***
## Scene 1
### Warehouse Uzzikh
---
### Context
The Uzzikh have been "interrogating" elves for nearly two days now. Many elven lives have been taken for frustratingly little information. It seems to be a dead-end for Bloodsnout, until recently. This elf is different, younger but also not as broken as the others. If anyone knows anything it is this one. This is why he has been particularly vicious, this is his last chance to find what they did with Rashan, shade of his heart.

The players may choose to use diplomacy with Bloodsnout, as he asks who are fools enough to attack The Uzzikh and why? He doesn't consider taking Elven lives to be wrong, and legitimately doesn't know why they are here. If the players kill all the Orks though, he will consider them assassins and will fight to the death. While there are still at least 2 other Uzzikh remaining he will consider ceasing the fighting to preserve his warriors, once again enquiring why they are attacking and who they are.
#### Warehouse main floor
_As the door to the central warehouse is opened, it is the smell that assaults you before your eyes adjust to the dim light. Death. The dried smell of blood, sinew and bone. But this is no tannery, you see a number of ork soldiers lounging most of them paying little attention. The horrible smell finds explanation in a pile of elven bodies discarded on the far side of the warehouse. Closer though, you can see the most recent victims, somewhat flayed and mutilated, fastened by ropes to tables or against crates. The ropes feel obscene, as the elves lay limp and unconscious. From a small enclosed room you can see light from the windows and hear the screams, an interrogation still underway._
#### Bloodsnout (in office interrogating Veylith)
_A monstrous ork wearing red and purple command leathers. He has prominent tusks piercing from his lower jaw. Strapped to his back is a bat wrapped tightly in barbed wire. The wood is stained red and the wire drips with fresh red rains, pooling at his feet._
#### Successful Resolution
Rescuing Veylith is success however it is done. Players Level up to 3.

If all the Uzzikh are killed, reinforcements will return with more Elven captives hourly. They will engage, but flee quickly to fetch more troops. 
Rumours will begin to circulate about the Elven Resistance and that some have allied themselves with the Elves. The Pact will increase its intolerance of the Elves and murder them with increased aggression. Elves will start to revolt/fight back and everything will worsen. Food crisis worsens since Elves no longer work peaceably.

If the players make a deal with Bloodsnout, he will forgive any deaths. But he will expect the party to find and return Rashan, he will admit he has no idea who or what has taken her, but he doesn't believe in any elven myth nonsense. General city condition will not worsen.
