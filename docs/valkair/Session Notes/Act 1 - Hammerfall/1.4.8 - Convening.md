elven rebellion pt 5

## Opening Monologue
With speed and guile, you slipped through the cracks of war and found your way into the Pact’s command tent.  
The commanders had tricks—but they were no match for your willingness for violence and the element of surprise. Steel met flesh, words were few, and soon you stood over their corpses as torchlight flooded the hillside beyond.

You vanished before they arrived—into the catacombs, hidden paths etched into the bones of the city by elven hands long dead. Few remember them. Fewer still would dare walk them.

Now, you are gone. And in your absence, only blood remains.

Spirits are high. Hope takes root.  
Could this rebellion succeed? Could you, within the very walls of your oppressors, carve out something real?

You dare not look too far ahead. But the victories are no longer scattered—they are piling up.

Now comes the next decision.

Around you, voices rise in fervent debate, coalescing into two camps.

**Aelion**, the battle-scarred commander, urges swift action.  
The Pact’s local leadership lies dead. Their warcamps are adrift. This is the moment to strike. Without their officers, the veterans may parley—if the offer is strong, or the fear is greater than their loyalty. Wait too long, and new command will tighten the leash once more.

But **Theren**, calm and resolute, warns against haste.  
He speaks of sacred ground, ancient rites, and a ritual that must begin now. Heimdall’s temple still stands, and within it, elven devout lie hidden—ready to awaken the spirits of old. They may yet drive the Pact from this place with forces far older than sword or command.

The time for decision has come again.

As voices rise, **Veylith** lifts a hand—and silence falls.

**“To which cause will you lend your strength, friends?”**
## Scene 1

## H7 - Heimdall's Temple
H7 - Defend the elves as they do some spell. This will cleanse H7, H11 and H8 of Pact forces if successful.
Story: Elves are conducting powerful arcane ritual reestablishing connection the elven spirits which inhabit Heimdalls Temple and the Adjacent Ancient Elven Tomb. Defend the elven ritual casters for 10 rounds so the ritual can be completed.

Successful completion of the ritual:

*The final chant rings out—rising above the clash of steel,
*A sudden horror grips you.*  
*Then, the ground trembles.*

*From the cracked stone and soil, ghostly hands claw their way into the waking world—wreathed in pale green flame, trailing motes of ancestral power.*  
*They seize Pact soldiers mid-step, burning through armor, flesh, and spirit alike.*

*Above, spectral figures whirl like a storm—ancient elves clad in ceremonial war garb, their eyes hollow, glowing with a long hunger.*  
*One by one, they descend—driving themselves into the hearts of horrified Pact soldiers.*

*The possessed drop their weapons first. Then drop to their knees. Then, as if the weight of death itself has claimed them, they collapse face-first onto the stone ground. 
*Black ichor seeps from their mouths, pooling beneath now lifeless forms.*  
*Not a single Pact soldier remains*

With their unholy task completed,
*One by one, the spirits lift their hollow eyes to the sky.*  
*Their forms unravelling like smoke caught in moonlight—drifting upward, fading, slipping back beyond the veil.*  
*Within moments, all is quiet.*

*Only the dead remain… and the memory of this horrible ancient power.*
