The rebellion of the Elves of Hammerfall continues
## Opening Monologue

*You are no longer outcasts at the edge of a dying rebellion.*

*You have struck with precision and courage—rescuing every elf from the jaws of the Pact's onslaught. Families once splintered have been reunited. Among those saved, three voices rise above the rest:*  
***Aelion Varethil**, the weathered war-commander with deep roots in tradition;*  
***Theren Silquar**, calm and composed, bearing the mystic lineage of arcane scholars;*  
*And **Vaelen Duskthorn**, fire-eyed and unyielding, carrying the will of the gods.*

*Together, they lend weight and direction to the movement—each a banner under which others now rally.*

*But the war map tells a grim truth: for every hex reclaimed, the Pact takes two more. Their control spreads like wildfire, and your victories—though hard-won—hang by threads of resolve and blood.*

*This is no longer about a single mission. It is a war of inches, of sacrifice and ground held.*
## The debrief

### Elven war council
---
_The success of your previous efforts is visible as you reflect on the vibrancy of the discussion of our next move. Aelion, Theren and Vaelen not only bring another perspective but unify a section of the Elven people behind them, each representing an important facet of elven culture and belief. The discussion is heated; should we press our advantage of surprise and strike hard against The Pact themselves or is it too soon, and instead we ensure we fortify our position and allow any remaining elves to flee and further strengthen our banners. Eventually the crowd quietens, expectantly awaiting to hear to which effort you will lend your strength._

## H5 - The crossroads

### Secure the crossroads
---
_The terrain naturally plateaus in the middle of this region. Buildings on either side of this plateau have been destroyed and passage is difficult around its overlook. If either side can secure and fortify this position it will hold an important staging and defensive position._

Benefit = -5 to DC to passively take regions
## Session Notes
Hantz is cured of Filth Fever!
PCs took H5, took the strategic position.
Map was cool, some inventive strategies. PCs used the horn to gain an advantage. Combat was close (Math is TIGHT)
