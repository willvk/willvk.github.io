The drip drip drip of constant water inside the temple is almost calming now, as you have grown used to it. Perhaps its is the water nymphs blessing which makes it feel comforting. It should not be, many metres under the sea sustained by some old forgotten magic. It seems to be deteriorating though, as moss, slime and algae are displaced by new cracks and flooding of water. Your presence here does seem to be having destructive impact. I just hope we can find Njords rune before this whole place collapses or floods with us still inside. When we overcame the sea devils; the shining bioluminescent markings etched into the stone of this circular antechamber suddenly grew dim. It suddenly struck that it couldn't have been a coincidence. No sooner was the last of those devils dispatched than these strange runes which seem to say something of commerce suddenly became dormant. Similar the treasure chest which was glimmering with gold, was revealed to be rusted iron and barnacle encrusted, the vegetables stores instantly rotten and disheveled and the shining shield dull and heavy. The temple seemed to pulsate which a moment of calm and then a thunderous eruption of water flooded the alcove sweeping us back towards that surging maelstrom in the centre of the room. Luckily, with the use of these blessed fins, we were able to exit the river as it grew shallow. Suddenly back in the central chamber, it seems there are two more alcoves and the fighting with the creatures from each continues unabated.

### **Room 3 – 

**Purpose:** Reveal the temple’s corruption.

- Once a grand hall where Njord’s followers debated philosophy. Now, it’s a **battlefield**—the three mad priests’ undead forces clash eternally.
    
- The PCs arrive during a **lull in the fighting**, but soon both sides notice them.
    

**Encounter Options:**

- PCs can **sneak, deceive, or fight** through shifting fronts of skeletal sailors, drowned acolytes, and sea-spawn.
    
- Discover runes describing the **Binding Ritual** that sank the temple.
    
- Success grants knowledge of how to **undo the seal**—or a relic needed to reach the heart of the temple.


### Transition
*The last sigil fades, and for a heartbeat the water stills. Then—like a held breath released—the chamber surges. Waves crash from every alcove, washing over the walls and sweeping away centuries of grime. The rot, the algae, the stink of decay—gone. For a moment, the lake feels alive again, light shimmering through the water like the touch of dawn.*

*At the chamber’s center, the whirlpool slows, softens, and unravels. Beneath it, a calm spiral of pale blue light glows along the steps leading down. The way to Njord’s heart is open…*

### **Room 4 

## ⚓ **Room 4: The War Beneath the Tide**

**Location:** The Drowned Sanctum  
**Tone:** Murky light, drifting debris, and ancient silence. Three motionless figures kneel in a ritual circle, golden chains of seaweed binding them to the floor.

---

### 🌊 **Setup**

- The spiral staircase from Room 3 opens into a vast, dome-shaped chamber.
    
- Three acolytes of Njord (Eirik, Sefa, Halvard) kneel equidistant around a broken altar, their eyes clouded, their bodies twitching.
    
- Suspended above them drifts a **Spirit of Corruption** — a warped soul of the fourth priest, now reduced to a hateful flame-like wraith burning beneath the water.
    


> “Three figures kneel in silence, seaweed chains binding them. Between them burns a pale blue fire that should not burn underwater—its light pulsing like a heartbeat.”

### 💀 **The Spirit of Malice**

- Use a **Flameskull** or **ghost-type stat block**, reflavored as a drowned, skeletal visage wreathed in abyssal flame.
    
- **Each round**, it _possesses_ one of the acolytes (roll d3).
    
- The possessed acolyte awakens, glowing with Njord’s divine power twisted by corruption, and uses that aspect for a round:
- Eirik the Tide-Caller, Sefa the Trademistress, and Halvard the Deep-Walker
    

| Aspect              | Round Effect                                                                           | Visual                                |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Current** (Eirik) | Torrents of water lash the room, pushing or slamming PCs (Reflex save vs bludgeoning). | Room spins in a slow whirlpool.       |
| **Commerce** (Sefa) | Creates illusions of gold and air bubbles that explode (Will save vs mental).          | Gilded coins shimmer, then burst.     |
| **Depth** (Halvard) | Drains light and warmth; cold damage and concealment.                                  | Darkness pools from the floor upward. |

### ⚔️ **Mechanics of Possession**

- **Freeing an acolyte:**
    
    - When an acolyte reaches 0 HP or when the PCs use a **Religion or Occultism check (DC 25)** as a 2-action ritual to “break the corruption,” the spirit is forced out for 1 round and becomes targetable.
        
    - When exposed, the spirit becomes _vulnerable to all damage_.
        
    - After 1 round, it dives into another acolyte.
        
- **If all acolytes die**, the spirit’s form stabilizes — but now empowered and enraged, causing the temple’s collapse (bad ending).
    
- **If the PCs manage to destroy the spirit while keeping at least one acolyte alive**, Njord’s blessing purifies the waters and the temple _rises_ again.
    

---

### 🧭 **Environmental Features**

- **Rising Pressure:** Each round, cracks spread in the sanctum’s dome; water roars in and currents shift. It adds urgency without requiring a timer.
    
- **Floating Debris / Statues:** Use Athletics to move or take cover in 3D underwater terrain.

### ⚖️ **End States**

| Outcome                                | Result                                              | Visual                                      |
| -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Spirit Destroyed, Acolytes Live**    | Temple purified, lake clears, Njord’s symbol glows. | Waters shimmer blue; temple slowly ascends. |
| **Spirit Freed, Acolytes Slain**       | Temple collapses; corruption spreads upward.        | Black water churns, sanctum implodes.       |
| **Partial Success** (1–2 acolytes die) | Temple cracks but stabilizes; water clears slowly.  | A bittersweet peace — a scar remains.       |

### **Room 5 

**Purpose:** Resolution and transformation.

- If the PCs **raise the temple**, the stagnant lake drains, revealing a shining blue sanctum—Njord’s voice whispers thanks, granting each hero **Njord’s Blessing (once per day: Freedom of Movement or Calm Waters aura)**.
    
- If they fail and destroy it, the waters are cleared of corruption—but the malevolent spirit whispers and promises vengeance in future tides.

Symbol of Njord is at the base of the statue (4/8)
Heroes return to hammerfall and report progress
All seems well. Council meeting next day.

## **The Acolyte’s Recollection**

I remember the first time I saw her. Hannah.  
Back then, she weren’t the Forsaken—just a hard girl with flat ears and eyes like stormlight. The kind the pretty folk spat on, but the kind you followed ‘cause she never looked afraid.

I were nothin’, pickin’ fights, takin’ coin from those who didn’t fight back. But she… she made us _believe_. Said the elves left us to rot ‘cause they feared the blood that ran through her veins. Said the world itself had turned its back on strength.

Then came the hooded one. Said he served the Fiend Below—the Lord of the Depths, **Osgilliath**. Promised her power to break every chain, to tear down every highborn hall that cast her out. Hannah listened. She always listened when power spoke.

We followed her beneath the old city, through catacombs older than light. There, she found her altar—a black stone carved with runes that bled when touched. She cut off her own arms before we could stop her. Laughed while she did it.  
And when the blood hit the stone, the pit answered.

Osgilliath filled her veins with molten fire. Her arms grew back, twisted and beautiful, claws like burning iron. She screamed, and the scream became a hymn. Hannah died on that cross, and in her place stood **The Forsaken**.

She fed us at her blood after. Told us to drink if we wanted to see the world made right. I did. The pain was holy and beautiful. My skin burned, split, and healed stronger. My heart stopped for a moment—and when it beat again, I could hear him. The voice in the deep.

Now, centuries have turned, and still we serve. Her blood flows through us. Her will drives us. And soon Hannah the Forsaken will rise again. Now that a new host has been found. He looks at Ivar.
Now we have all we need. 

I followed the path. I led you fools through the catacombs, through the dark. Releasing her from that prison as had to be done. Her mind and soul returned to Osgilliaths service. All we needed was another suitable host, another of Heimdalls line. A soul with enough power to hold her, at least for a time.
I have served faithfully, I have listened to you fools prattle. But now that all that is done.
....now I have lost all my patience.
He raises his arms from beneath the dark robes, exposing hooked claws and demonic limbs.
