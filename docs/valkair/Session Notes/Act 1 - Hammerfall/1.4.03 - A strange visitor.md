A father comes to call
## Opening Monologue

The sacred hunt is done, Hrimgaldr captured and the gods honour you. All of hammerfall seemed to trek to the Godstooth thought the path was winding and filled with smoke and old prayers. The Pact led the passage, The Speaker, Ivar, Orgrim, Trader Yennen all there to honor the Gods. You were the prize piece however and more than just the Pact saw your glory and learned your names.

At the altar stone, the speaker invoked the eyes of the gods and spilled Hrimgaldr upon the rock. Mead and sacred blood was spread and the chanting and blood haze filled your nostrils, ears and sights.

Brawn saw all his strength and some of his powerlessness
Hanzt came next and toyed with whether it is the Guild or just in his nature to harm others
Riven once more laid down a token given in kindness and saw the world blur horrifyingly before his eyes

and Gunnar...
### **Opening Scene: The Tomb Reawakens**

The world around Gunnar **freezes** mid-step. Time stops. The trees blacken and the air burns cold. A low _thrum_ pulses in his ears. The world **blinks**—  
—and he finds himself standing in the center of a **stone tomb**, lined with runes that glow with **Odin’s eye** and **Hel’s chill**. Shadows dance unnaturally across the walls.

A **baby screams**. His scream.

> **Narration:**  
> You hear your own voice—not as it is now, but as it was then. Your first cry, full of pain and hunger, echoing across the stone like an accusation.

At the far end of the room, **a robed elven woman stands**, sobbing and holding a bundled newborn. Surrounding her are **Guild robed figures**, dwarves and orcs, their faces hidden. The woman’s hands tremble as she holds the babe out.

> **Optional Insight Check:** Reveals her features resemble Gunnar’s—this is his mother.

The leader of the Guild steps forward with a ceremonial blade and says:

> _“Do this, and you are one of us. No one will question your loyalty. No one will touch you again.”_

She nods. She kneels. The blade is raised.  
Then—**she hesitates**.

Suddenly, she **spins** and throws the blade at the robed figures, hitting one in the throat. The room **erupts in shouts**.

She **rushes to the altar**, places a **mirror-like charm** on the baby’s chest, and **screams** in ancient Elvish.

> _“Odin, let this child be seen! Let him be known to the gods!”_

She **slices open her own chest**, pouring blood onto the stone. **A blast of divine force erupts**, incinerating the chamber.

### 🔥 **Scene 2 – The Raid**

The white fades to a roaring fire. The scene cuts rapidly:

- **Elven forest homes burning**.
    
- **Orc warriors of The Pack rampaging**, cutting down elves.
    
- A **young elf woman** (Gunnar’s mother) flees through trees.
    
- An **orc leader** grabs her, armored and massive, his face shadowed.
    
- The sound cuts. We don’t see the act—only the woman screaming and the forest turning black.
    
### **Scene 3 – The Tomb Reopened**

Darkness. Stone dust falls through the light. Shadows flicker.  
We see **The Pack**, discovering the **burial chamber**, the aftermath of the ritual

- The bodies of Guild agents are charred skeletons.
    
- The **mirror charm glows faintly**, protecting the child—**Gunnar, still alive**, 
    
A gruff orc steps forward and laughs:

> _“What in the gods’ balls is this?”_

Another orc pulls back the cloth and sees the pointed ears, small tusks.

> _“Half-breed... Elven blood.”_

> “Then we leave it.”  
> “No. He’s breathing. This child has survived this. We will see what he can become”

They take him.

### 🔍 **Scene 4 – The Laughing God**

The tomb fades, and **Loki’s face flickers into view**, lips curled into a grin, reclining lazily in an impossible space of wine, mirrors, and broken weapons.

> **Loki:**  
> _“Born of pain. Swaddled in ruin. Raised by the very beasts that broke your mother. Hah! The irony could wake Hel herself.”_
> 
> _“But here you are, my lovely little wolf... A bastard of gods and monsters. Don’t you wonder which side you’ll choose?”_

A mirror appears again—this time showing Gunnar’s reflection **split** down the middle:

- One side glowing faintly with **divine light** and elven grace.
    
- The other burning with **orcish fire and bloodlust**.
    

> **Choice (Player Optional):**
> 
> - Smash the mirror: Deny both sides—forge his own.
>     
> - Embrace the light: Accept some divine purpose. Some elven legacy
>     
> - Embrace the fire: Choose strength and the Pack’s legacy.
>     

> Loki winks and says:  
> _“Either way... you’re going to make such a lovely mess.”_

You all come to. It is cold on the peak and the wine and the visions have cleared. You trek down the mountain

## 🍻 Act III: The Blótfeast at the Black Tide Tavern

### ❖ Setting:

The **Black Tide Tavern** is packed. Roaring fires, heaped tables, mead barrels cracked open. A longhall built of blackened oak and carved with old symbols, once used as a hall of judgment, now reborn as the heart of celebration.

**Then the doors slam open...**

>"I have walked the road of stars and stone, yet no place has the stink of old destiny like this one! Pour me a drink, you sad bastards! This is a day for stories, song, and challenge!"

**Heimdall arrives.** Charismatic, booming, wrapped in furs and old leather, he leaps onto a table with a horn of his own brew and demands the night begin.

## 🎉 Tavern Games

### 1. **The Boast & Boon**

- One by one, characters stand atop a shield and tell:
    
    - A boast  
      Gunnar boasted about Rivens accuracy with a bow. Heimdall challenged him by pushing him off balance then throwing an apple - which Riven precisely speared moments later, pinning it into the wall. To the roars and cheers of the tavern.
        
    - A lie so bold it must be true
        
    - A story that stirs the gods

**Heimdall judges.** Those who impress receive a token of favor—reroll, small magical charm, or advantage on a fate-related check in future.

---

### 2. **Trial of the Cup**

- Rounds of drinking.
    
- CON saves (increasing DCs)

			Brawn dying because he is not strong enough

## Session Notes

Group learned a lot about Hannah from Heimdall.  
Hannah is Heimdall's daughter, tho he has never seen or met her. Hannah's mother is High Queen Aduni. Hanzt correctly recalled the current High King is Caerdan Thrandurassil who has a statue to himself. Heimdall has some tenuous awareness or link to Hannah for whatever reason. Though he has sired many children perhaps Hannah is special somehow, either way it is rare that someone disappear and then return suddenly a long time later.  
Heimdall implored them to save her, though he has no idea what has become of her.  
Heimdall told them of the catacombs under the city, were as deep as the city is wide. Beneath the shallows there existed 8 temples, one for each of the old gods. Perhaps they hold some answers as to where Hannah is.  (Group correctly stated they have explored 2 so far)  
Fun, laid back session. Some of the group were still processing visions.
