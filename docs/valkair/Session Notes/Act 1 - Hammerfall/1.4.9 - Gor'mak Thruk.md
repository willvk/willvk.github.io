Convince the soldiers this fight isn't worth their lives

## Opening Monologue
Heimdall's Temple still stinks of burned flesh and cold earth.  
You can almost hear the last whispers of the spirits—like the hiss of wind through the broken stone walls of the ruin.

The Pact forces were broken here. Their banners lie in the mud, their now unholy dead left unclaimed, sitting amongst pools of black ichor. It is a horror and word of what was done here will spread.

What was meant to be the swift extermination of a people has become a grinding, bloody campaign they did not expect… and perhaps cannot stomach.

Now, Pact forces have fallen back, clinging to only two strongholds—one their command post - the original "distribution centre" and, the other a makeshift camp holding what remains of their strength. Still plenty to thwart a threat as meek as the remnants of the elves, or so they would have expected. 
They have taken wounds in flesh and in pride, and whispers run through their ranks: _“Is this fight worth the coin? Is it worth our lives?”_

These are not zealots, nor patriots—just veterans and thrill-seekers promised easy pay and easier prey.  
But the prey has bared its fangs, and the cost of this war rises with every sunrise.

If you can show them strength—and perhaps, offer them something worth more than their commanders’ orders—you may yet turn swords aside without shedding more blood.
## Scene 1

### H10 - Parley with the Warhorde
---
These soldiers aren’t ideologues. They're **veterans, killers, and thrill-seekers**, loyal not to cause but to **coin, habit, and reputation**. Many of them fight for three reasons:

1. **Combat Boredom** – They live for the challenge, but the elves aren't one.
2. **Easy Prestige** – Fighting helpless enemies earns them status with little risk. 
3. **Structure & Survival** – Being part of a unit keeps them fed, sheltered, and pointed somewhere.

Without leadership, they're **rudderless**, and while some see opportunity, others see chaos.

Key mindset traits:

- **Cynical**: They’ve seen officers die before. They expect someone else will step in.
- **Pragmatic**: If the war turns costly, they’ll walk away.
- **Ego-driven**: They respect strength and reputation, not morality or pity.
- **Restless**: Some want a fight—just a good, honorable one—not endless slaughter.

They’re not stupid. If the PCs show strength and promise change (better loot, less risk, purpose), the soldiers may back off and look the other way.

**1. Korran the Bloodred** _(Ork veteran, de facto warband leader)_

- Once a field commander, now leading by respect alone. He’s old, scarred, and practical.
- **Wants**: A challenge worthy of his skill, not butchery.
- **Fears**: Being forgotten, dying pointlessly.
- **Might Say**:
    > “You want to save the god-forsaken elves? Why should I listen to you?

**2. Braya Skullveil** _(Human duelist, whip-smart tactician)_

- Hates elves. Loves winning. But she can read the wind.
- **Wants**: Survival, spoils, and a future with less mess.
- **Might Say**:
    > “We’re not gonna die in some alley for a city that’ll forget our names. You want peace? Whats in it for me?”
    
### **Phase 1: Opening**

PCs enter the warcamp. It's tense. Dozens of fighters watch.  
NPCs challenge them—_“Why should we listen to you?”_

Skill checks:

- **Intimidation** to command respect
- **Persuasion** to start talks
- **History/Insight** to reference the pact’s false promises or how previous wars ended

Failing this phase might lead straight to a duel, or losing the crowd's interest.

### **Phase 2: The Pitch**

PCs must present reasons to stop fighting:

- Losses are mounting
- The elves are fighting back—hard
- There’s no leadership anymore
- There’s no loot in burned homes
- A better deal may await

Skill checks:

- **Deception/Persuasion** to promise better outcomes
- **Performance** to rouse the crowd
- **Insight** to read who’s winnable and who’s spoiling for blood

Roleplay bonuses: invoke the duel idea _before_ violence starts:
> “Rather than bury your dead in the mud, test our strength. Let this war rest on one final clash.”

Just scribble anything down here, its important to record ending point or if there is any hooks or decisions as we need to reference that next session.
