visitor to the tavern
## Opening Monologue
_Varka leans against the heavy bar, arms busy with work, still ripped with defined muscle despite her casual stance. Her voice suddenly cuts through to you, low and rough like gravel in a cup._

‚ÄúI‚Äôve never much cared for honors. Medals don‚Äôt warm you at night, and renown won‚Äôt stop a dagger in your ribs when the time comes.‚Äù

_She looks each of you in the eye, one at a time‚Äîmeasuring_

‚ÄúBut things‚Äôve changed. Loki‚Äôs Hand is broken and folk in Mongeet and the poorer Shallows are lookin‚Äô for who‚Äôll step up next. Looking for someone to lead and give them a reason to stand and fight.

‚ÄúThe Midsomerbl√≥t is upon us. The sacred hunt. Each year it is said that the gods release a mighty beast spirit "Hrimgaldr" which comes and inhabits a worthy animal in the Lost Woods. Capture it and return it for sacrifice to the gods at Midsomerbl√≥t, and your names‚Äôll be sung across all of Hammerfall and the villages beyond. Feasts. Favors. Doors opened that‚Äôve been shut tight your whole lives.‚Äù

_Then a sly grin:_

‚ÄúAnd‚Ä¶ well, let‚Äôs just say this tavern won‚Äôt go dry for a month and everyone will forget about our little rats problem‚Äù

‚ÄúSo what do you say? Want to make the gods look down and take notice?‚Äù

## Session Notes

The group set out on the Hunt eager to capture Hrimgaldr, and warned that if they killed the boar that it would instead curse the village to famine and disfavor amongst the gods.

Gunnar contacted Loki in order to find the Sacred Grove. He poured some wine on the ring and kissed it. Loki helped him, telling him to proceed when there seems no path.

Riven did well on some survival checks / nature checks to find the path.

Group chose to try to help the dryad and offered to remove the rot infecting her and her tree.  Overall they made a good impression on her. 

Hanzt took time to bathe in the healing waters of the pool in the Sacred Grove. He now has a boon to his recovery from disease (filth fever).

The group tried to overpower Hrimgaldr but just as they looked to have calm'd the boars and overpowered him. Orc hunters emerged from the woods and killed the boar.
