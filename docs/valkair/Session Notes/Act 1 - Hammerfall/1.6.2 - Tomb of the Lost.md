PCs continue the ygritte rescue attempt

## Opening Monologue

The air is still—thick with dust and the echo of shifting stone. Behind you, the path has sealed, the grinding weight of the tomb closing you off from all retreat. The Speaker’s hollow gaze lingers in your mind, his face motionless as the barrier slid into place. Whatever his purpose, his meaning is clear: there is no turning back.

You stand now within the **Tomb of the Lost**—a place untouched by time, carved into the bones of the earth. The walls weep with condensation, the stone slick and cold beneath your fingers. The faint scent of age and decay lingers, heavy and unmoving.

Moments ago, you watched the truth unravel upon the mural—the **royal family tree**, ancient and proud, yet scarred by deceit. The name of **Hannah**, hidden beneath Queen Aduni’s line, revealed by your hand. A daughter erased from history, her bloodline struck from memory.

Now, only silence answers your questions. The Speaker is gone, and the way home entombed. The corridor ahead yawns like a throat, swallowing the faint light you carry. Somewhere in the depths, the truth waits—buried beneath stone, shadow, and secrecy.

Only forward.

Room Three:   
- if they try right, it is sealed with no obvious way to open
- if they go left (open door) then;
- Speaker locks the Thrandurassil tomb entrance behind them, no way back
Room Four:   
- Leftover Blood Elves here, kinda dormant
- centre pyramid, atop the pyramid Queen Aduni and King Hadrans tombs + statues
- secret moving aduni's statue reveals a hatch below
- Atop the pyramid, one of the chosen confronts them, with his pet demon
- he awakens any undiscovered Blood Elves
- Ygrittes captors seem to have gotten away
- Giant sealed door with no obvious way to open, depicts the Pilgrimage of the Eight and seems to be missing 8 symbols
- Secret passage leads back to room 2 
Room Five:   
- Hannah's tomb, the sarcophagus (cheap) is empty.

Notes:
- babau (demon) escaped
- cool fight, with multiple levels and some good maneuvrability, the darkness then dispel was cool. Counteract is such a pain in the ass, honestly need to preplan counteracts ahead of time and prepare cheatsheets for it. Would be good if there was more automation for it.
- hannah/aduni stuff went well
