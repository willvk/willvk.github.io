# Motivation
An opportunity for storytelling and playing through the Viking Ages of middle eastern europe. The Vikings and the Norse mythology tell of an intriguing time of; exploration, brutality, heroism but also venturing out to find a better world for your people and family. It is a tale of clashing cultures and the spread of religion in the face of horrifying foes - pure unadulterated violence met with a bare neck of faithfulness and fanatiscism. These are intriguing themes and a setting which is of simple people and their desires but complex situations, politics and belief-systems oh and some cool monsters.
# Annnnnnnnd why should I care 
The archetypal Viking is a common ttrpg trope, a brutal fearless and powerful warrior. The Viking Ages of history are about as close to real fantasy as you can get. Their mythology speaks of strange warlike gods who exemplify the honor of battle and the dedication to a skillful pursuit. It is rare in current times to deify or idolize violence but the Norse mythos does this all the time. The norse gods also emulate human stupidity and lustfulness at times with stories which speak to great power or accomplishment as a reward for true gruesome sacrifice or mastery of some trial. The gods are not infallible however and many of Loki's stories tell of deceit or progeny as a consequence of an ill-considered action. It is simple and creates great opportunities for ttrpg storytelling.

[[The Middens]], our starting area, are intriguing due to their wild nature and untamed feel. The world is yet to be explored and conquered; especially for the humans, orcs or other mongrel-races who are mostly nomadic warrior tribes devoted to Norse gods. Monsters lurk around corners and safety is not a common feeling. Monsters wear many faces however and sometimes other tribes are just as much of a threat as a supernatural creature.

The [[Elves]] are an exception to the other barbarian races, as they are not new to these lands. They are mysterious, advanced and almost tolkien-esque in that they are represented as magical, immortal creatures who are part of the old world. They have mastered cities, monuments, stoneworking and magics. They understand the world but they do not share their knowledge, instead they hoard their secrets and look down upon the other races as barbarians. Lately though elven cities have become ruins; abandoned, and with the ruling class missing. Elven nobility are now even more reclusive, if they still exist at all, and with them the secrets of the world retreat into hidden places out of reach of all but the most dogged in their pursuit.

# Genre, Tone & Feel
Valkair is a **low-magic fantasy world**, deeply rooted in the raw realism of the Viking Age, where survival is brutal, and the gods are ever watchful. Its myths and beliefs draw from both Norse and early Christian traditions, shaping a land where faith, fate, and the will of the divine intertwine with daily life. Magic is rare, hoarded by those who understand its power. Only the **Elves** wield true arcane mastery, though their knowledge is secret and alien to mortals. Other races may possess mystical wisdom tied to **nature, the elements, or divine favor**, but such power is fleeting, never fully controlled. Herbalists, oracles, and witches exist, their craft blending the natural with the supernatural, but true magic is scarce—charlatans outnumber the gifted, and [[Loki]]'s trickery lurks in every promise of power.

The world feels **new, raw, and undiscovered**. Civilization clings to the edges of a vast, untamed land where every step forward is a test of worth. **Glory is the only path to immortality**, and common folk must prove themselves through **heroic deeds**, forging their names into legend so they may stand among the honored dead in **Odin’s hall of Valhalla**. Yet **these trials are not easy**—**death is frequent, life is cheap, and only the strongest endure**.

Valkair is a world of **darkness and horror**. **Monsters unknown to the world** prowl the shadows, and ignorance breeds fear as people struggle to understand the terrors that surround them. Change is relentless, hardship unending. All most folk crave is a warm hearth and a night without nightmares, but **safety is an illusion**. The gods are **fickle**, honoring only those who **fight, bleed, and sacrifice for their place in history**. To live an unremarkable life is to be forgotten, ignored by both men and gods alike. Trust is rare—**each must defend their own hearth and home, for no other can be relied upon**.
