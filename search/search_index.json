The Viking Ages of history are about as close to real fantasy as you can get. Their mythology speaks of strange warlike gods who exemplify the honor of battle and the dedication to a skillful pursuit. It is rare in current times to deify or idolize violence but the Norse mythos does this all the time. The norse gods also emulate human stupidity and lustfulness at times with stories which speak to great power or accomplishment as a reward for true gruesome sacrifice or mastery of some trial. The gods are not infallible however and many of Loki's stories tell of deceit or progeny as a consequence of an ill-considered action. It is simple and creates great opportunities for ttrpg storytelling.</p> <p>The Middens, our starting area, are intriguing due to their wild nature and untamed feel. The world is yet to be explored and conquered; especially for the humans, orcs or other mongrel-races who are mostly nomadic warrior tribes devoted to Norse gods. Monsters lurk around corners and safety is not a common feeling. Monsters wear many faces however and sometimes other tribes are just as much of a threat as a supernatural creature.</p> <p>The Elves are an exception to the other barbarian races, as they are not new to these lands. They are mysterious, advanced and almost tolkien-esque in that they are represented as magical, immortal creatures who are part of the old world. They have mastered cities, monuments, stoneworking and magics. They understand the world but they do not share their knowledge, instead they hoard their secrets and look down upon the other races as barbarians. Lately though elven cities have become ruins; abandoned, and with the ruling class missing. Elven nobility are now even more reclusive, if they still exist at all, and with them the secrets of the world retreat into hidden places out of reach of all but the most dogged in their pursuit.</p>"},{"location":"valkair/World%20Overview/#genre-tone-feel","title":"Genre, Tone &amp; Feel","text":"<p>Valkair is a low-magic fantasy world, deeply rooted in the raw realism of the Viking Age, where survival is brutal, and the gods are ever watchful. Its myths and beliefs draw from both Norse and early Christian traditions, shaping a land where faith, fate, and the will of the divine intertwine with daily life. Magic is rare, hoarded by those who understand its power. Only the Elves wield true arcane mastery, though their knowledge is secret and alien to mortals. Other races may possess mystical wisdom tied to nature, the elements, or divine favor, but such power is fleeting, never fully controlled. Herbalists, oracles, and witches exist, their craft blending the natural with the supernatural, but true magic is scarce\u2014charlatans outnumber the gifted, and [[Loki]]'s trickery lurks in every promise of power.</p> <p>The world feels new, raw, and undiscovered. Civilization clings to the edges of a vast, untamed land where every step forward is a test of worth. Glory is the only path to immortality, and common folk must prove themselves through heroic deeds, forging their names into legend so they may stand among the honored dead in Odin\u2019s hall of Valhalla. Yet these trials are not easy\u2014death is frequent, life is cheap, and only the strongest endure.</p> <p>Valkair is a world of darkness and horror.

All most folk crave is a warm hearth and a night without nightmares, but safety is an illusion. The gods are fickle, honoring only those who fight, bleed, and sacrifice for their place in history. To live an unremarkable life is to be forgotten, ignored by both men and gods alike.

He does not revel in slaughter nor favor blind violence. He teaches that battle must be fought with purpose\u2014whether to protect, to uphold justice, or to defend the weak. His warriors are knights, judges, and war-leaders, those who wield both sword and law in equal measure. They do not strike out in wrath but in measured, righteous fury, ensuring that the guilty are punished and that true justice prevails, no matter the cost.</p> <p>Though his justice is absolute, his mercy is not unheard of. He does not demand vengeance, but rather balance. A warrior who admits wrongdoing, pays their debt, and atones may yet find redemption in T\u00fdr\u2019s eyes\u2014but only if their penance is true and their sacrifice great.</p> <p>T\u00fdr is the last stand against chaos, the unyielding will of law and duty, and the one who bears the weight of justice even when it demands his own blood.</p>"},{"location":"valkair/Gods/Major%20Gods/Tyr/#followers-worship","title":"Followers &amp; Worship","text":"<ul> <li>Holy Sites: Great stone halls where oaths are sworn, battlefields where honorable warriors have fallen, and judgment chambers where justice is carried out.</li> <li>Worshippers: Knights, warlords, judges, lawbringers, executioners, and those who swear sacred oaths.</li> <li>Rituals:<ul> <li>The Oathbinding: Before battle or judgment, followers of T\u00fdr cut their palms and swear a solemn vow, sealing their word with blood.</li> <li>The One-Handed Sacrifice: Warriors who have failed their oaths but seek redemption may bind their right hand behind their back and fight with only their off-hand until their debt is paid.</li> <li>The Blade of Judgment: When passing sentence upon the guilty, priests of T\u00fdr dip their swords in red dye or blood, marking the condemned with the weight of justice.</li> </ul> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"valkair/Gods/Major%20Gods/Tyr/#blessings-curses","title":"Blessings &amp; Curses","text":"<ul> <li>T\u00fdr\u2019s Favor: Those blessed by T\u00fdr may find their blade striking true when enforcing justice, their resolve unshaken even in the face of death, and their word carrying the weight of divine authority.

It lays out 3 simple things; - A sorry lot you all looked meeting up at The Black Tide Tavern, 10 years it had been since some of you saw each other and after a quick greeting it was a grim tale from each of you. Down on your luck, friendless and penniless. However hopeless it seemed a burden shared is a burden halved, maybe together you can solve the immediate problem (a hungry bellow) and then later maybe some larger issues too. After all once upon a time you all were heroes, as you cast your minds back and remember. - Defeating the whole Scree Scree Rah clan of kobolds, eventually capturing one to identify the secret passage of the Elves. - Overcoming the Elf soldiers and smashing the magical portal, destroying the elves and their dark magics. Freeing that poor trapped girl, what was her name again? - Those first few steps in Upper Hammerfall, unopposed by the Elves and greeting your allies as the city fell to your hands. That was long ago now though, as you sit in soggy row boat on loan from \"Low Tide\". The instructions were clear, we were to meet the smugglers north of Hammerfall a short distance. Where the river bends. It wasn't too hard to find as they were hailed by a larger boat and shown to a cave mouth on the cliffs just above the rivers edge. You would have never found it by yourselves but sure enough behind the hedges and riverweed was a passage large enough for 1 man to walk upright. No sooner had you climbed up but the smugglers had sailed on and all you had was instructions...</p> <p>\"Get these packages to the Undercroft, follow the water it will lead you right. They have been wrapped but don't open them or break them! Kvarrac will have our heads....oh and be careful of the natives\"</p> <p>As these words faded into memory you have only one path as you look into the cave in front of you.  </p>"},{"location":"valkair/Session%20Notes/Act%201%20-%20Hammerfall/1.2.1%20-%20A%20toe%20in%20line/#scene-1","title":"Scene 1","text":""},{"location":"valkair/Session%20Notes/Act%201%20-%20Hammerfall/1.2.1%20-%20A%20toe%20in%20line/#smugglers-camp","title":"Smugglers Camp","text":""},{"location":"valkair/Session%20Notes/Act%201%20-%20Hammerfall/1.2.1%20-%20A%20toe%20in%20line/#mushroom-forest","title":"Mushroom Forest","text":""},{"location":"valkair/Session%20Notes/Act%201%20-%20Hammerfall/1.2.1%20-%20A%20toe%20in%20line/#abandoned-shrine","title":"Abandoned Shrine","text":""},{"location":"valkair/Session%20Notes/Act%201%20-%20Hammerfall/1.2.1%20-%20A%20toe%20in%20line/#murky-lake","title":"Murky Lake","text":""},{"location":"valkair/Session%20Notes/Act%201%20-%20Hammerfall/1.2.1%20-%20A%20toe%20in%20line/#scene-3","title":"Scene 3","text":""},{"location":"valkair/Session%20Notes/Act%201%20-%20Hammerfall/1.2.1%20-%20A%20toe%20in%20line/#betrayal","title":"Betrayal","text":"<p>scene description in italics, meant to be read aloud can also be the transitionary piece</p>"},{"location":"valkair/Session%20Notes/Act%201%20-%20Hammerfall/1.2.1%20-%20A%20toe%20in%20line/#wererats-attack","title":"Wererats attack","text":""},{"location":"valkair/Session%20Notes/Act%201%20-%20Hammerfall/1.2.1%20-%20A%20toe%20in%20line/#scene-4","title":"Scene 4","text":""},{"location":"valkair/Session%20Notes/Act%201%20-%20Hammerfall/1.2.1%20-%20A%20toe%20in%20line/#undercroft","title":"Undercroft","text":"<p>scene description in italics, meant to be read aloud can also be the transitionary piece</p>"},{"location":"valkair/Session%20Notes/Act%201%20-%20Hammerfall/1.2.1%20-%20A%20toe%20in%20line/#unload-the-goods","title":"Unload the goods","text":""},{"location":"valkair/Session%20Notes/Act%201%20-%20Hammerfall/1.2.1%20-%20A%20toe%20in%20line/#meet-with-varka","title":"Meet with Varka","text":""},{"location":"valkair/Session%20Notes/Act%201%20-%20Hammerfall/1.2.1%20-%20A%20toe%20in%20line/#session-notes","title":"Session Notes","text":"<p>Two package successfully delivered, each had 3 Cockatrice Eggs. - reward 50gp Group was suspicious of Loki's Hand having a rat inside for the guild Hantz convinced the party The Guild were after him 1 wererat died carrying a guild coin and a note saying \"take care of our little problem\" and 50gp They found a +1 dagger on the wererat The Naiad gave a water blessing to Hantz, no idea what it does yet.</p> <p>The group chose to befriend the Blindheim and the Naiad and even heal them of their ailments.</p> <p>Varka gave them free lodgings at the Black Tide Tavern, for now - while they were working with Lokis Hand</p>"},{"location":"valkair/Session%20Notes/Act%201%20-%20Hammerfall/1.2.2%20-%20A%20friend%20in%20need/","title":"1.2.2   A friend in need","text":"<p>One of the fingers of Loki's Hand is an elf.

You can see an arsenal of blades on his belt and tucked neatly into his leathers. But the oddest thing is the tail, long and hairless and only slightly visible in the dim light. He is aged but undoubtedly still spry, a threat of both experience and precision. Varka swirls the ale in her mug and clicks her tongue, as you enter the back room, iiiiif you're sure then... the fresh meat have aaaarrived. The figure smirks, the candlelight barely catching the gleam of sharp teeth beneath his hood. He steps forward into the light, I am Kvarrac and I need your help with something you are all uniquely suitable for. We must join together, to fight against the oppression in this city. I am sure you have felt its hardships, its injustice. Villains, Murderers and Brutes raised up to Kings. Before I explain further though, I need the oaths of each of you.

As he moves between you he names you all Wolves of Loki's Hand. Wolves are hungry, fierce and loyal. They hunt and work as a unit driving their prey into each others clutches. His tail curls joyfully and some tension is eased between Varka and Kvarrac. Loki's Hand has had to make unconventional allies, Kvarrac begins. In the 10 years since Hammerfall was taken The Pact have always held themselves and their foresworn above the common people in The Shallows. We have had to fend for ourselves whilst operating outside of their oversight. In recent months the food shortages have become severe for most peoples in The Shallows but we at least are left with somethin. The Elves of the Shallows however, well, The Pact considers feeding them a waste of food. Now we aren't an organisation of Bleeding Hearts but we have identified an opportunity, a trade, something which helps us both. We can get food into the city out of the sight of the guards and well, the elves - most of em at least, still hoard some magics and hidden knowledge about this city which well even The Pact don't know about. Trouble is, our main contact, the only one we deal with and have brought into the family - well he's missing. Supposedly some trouble with an elite detachment of Orks, calls themselves - the Uzzikh. Pretty high ranking in the Horde. I don't know the details but we can't be connected to the Elves, bad for business. Good news is, no-one knows that you've joined the family yet, now do they! Well except Balder, everyone round here knows he works at the Tide. That's why Balder won't be going on this little mission, we can't have people sniffing around here if anything goes balls up.

Oh and don't lead anyone back here to us! </p> <p>As you turn to leave, you realize you\u2019re no longer alone. Two figures have entered the room without a sound, standing just within the dim candlelight. How long have they been there?  The first is a woman\u2014sharp, wiry, and moving like she\u2019s already halfway out the door. Her sun-roughened skin and the faint scent of salt cling to her like a second skin, and her fingers drum impatiently against the hilt of a wickedly curved knife at her side.  \"The Riptide\"\u2014Brelka. *\"Welcome to the family, pups,\" she says, flashing a wry grin, though her gaze barely lingers on any of you. She speaks in quick, clipped tones, each word chasing the next as if she\u2019s got somewhere to be five minutes ago. \"You keep your noses clean, listen when it matters, and maybe you\u2019ll live long enough to be useful.\" With that, she brushes past you and begins speaking in hushed tones to Kvarrac.</p> <p>The second figure is a stark contrast\u2014a hunched, broad-shouldered man, his posture that of someone more used to bending over a body than standing upright in a conversation. His head is bald, the skin pallid, but it\u2019s the arms that catch your attention\u2014corded with muscle, lined with deep, jagged scars that tell a story of cuts given and taken alike. A belt at his waist bristles with bone saws, scalpels, and vials of something dark and unpleasant.  \"The Leech\"\u2014Grettir.  He eyes you up and down, his lips curling into something that might be a smirk or just the natural pull of his scarred face. His voice is slow, deliberate, almost mocking in contrast to Brelka\u2019s hurried cadence. \"Family, huh?\" he muses, rolling a small bone between his fingers. \"Haven\u2019t lost anyone yet, have you? You will. \u2018S the way of things. But that\u2019s what I\u2019m for.\" His smile is all teeth. \"If you\u2019ve got the coin, I can put you back together.\"</p> <p>Kvarrac barely has time to acknowledge the newcomers before Brelka rounds on him, eyes sharp as a hooked blade. \"So that\u2019s it?\" she snaps at him before he can open his mouth. \"You just throw them in the deep and hope they swim?\"</p> <p>Kvarrac\u2019s tail flicks once, his smirk fading. \"They\u2019ll be fine. They\u2019re Wolves now.\"</p> <p>\"Wolves? Please.\" Brelka\u2019s fingers drum against the hilt of her knife, her foot tapping restlessly. \"You want them running a job this hot without a handler? Without oversight? You\u2019re either getting bolder or dumber, Kvarrac, and I\u2019m betting on the latter.\"</p> <p>A growl rumbles in his throat, barely audible over the crackle of candlelight. \"I don\u2019t answer to you, Riptide.\"</p> <p>Brelka\u2019s laugh is humorless. \"No, you don\u2019t. But you\u2019ll answer when this blows up in your face. When the Pact sniff out your little food-for-magic scam and come knocking. But you're not the one who'll have to clean it up, are you? That's my job-keeping us safe when you decide you want to save the god-forsaken Elves.

And now, standing together, it\u2019s painfully clear. They are not subtle anymore.</p> <p>Brelka commands the room, her presence a jagged blade of mocking confidence and barely contained fury. She flashes a wicked grin and spreads her arms wide.</p> <p>\u201cWell, well. Look at the little pups, running around, sticking their necks out.

With garbage. With weak, pathetic elves.\u201d</p> <p>The insult lingers in the air, but Brelka\u2019s focus is already shifting, her gaze locking onto Kvarrac. A slow, knowing smile spreads across her face.</p> <p>\u201cI remember the promises you made, Kvarrac. The ones from all those years ago. When I found you\u2014half-starved and desperate\u2014in those same smuggling caves. You were hunted then, weren\u2019t you? The Guild wanted you dead. The Chosen wanted you gutted. Even the elves\u2014the ones you protect so dearly now\u2014shunned you.\u201d</p> <p>She laughs, but there\u2019s no humor in it. Only scorn.</p> <p>\u201cFor some reason, I thought your weakness back then was temporary.\u201d She tilts her head. \u201cI even wanted revenge on the same bastards who wanted you gone. So we made a family\u2014Varka, you, and me.

No more dead orcs who strayed too far. The guards used to be too scared to come to Mongeet. You got soft, Kvarrac. You stopped being a killer. You started playing caretaker. to orphans\u201d</p> <p>A heavy silence hangs over the room, but Brelka isn\u2019t finished.</p> <p>She turns back to Kvarrac, closing the last few steps between them. Her voice lowers, almost conspiratorial.</p> <p>\u201cUnfortunately, you already know this, don\u2019t you?\u201d</p> <p>A cruel smirk tugs at the corner of her lips.</p> <p>\u201cYou think you can just walk away?

You understand their futility but it doesn\u2019t matter, what could a single ork do to change the minds of the Pact. A hopeless endeavour. So you do your job. You distribute rotten bread and stinking fish to a crowd of starving elves like it was gold at the table of the Allfather but soon the well runs dry. A couple of folk need a cudgel to the head and a reminder to back off but mostly it is a simple job. You yell out a report to the other orks outside that s'all gone. When a stray Elf wanders in. He has a strange stagger about him, sort of a hobble and he is wearing an oversized cloak. It covers him head to toe. As he steps into the torchlight you hear that he is muttering some elvish. A repeating pattern of their sing song words.</p> <p>Vael'seran. Caer'valan Vael'seran. Caer'valan Vael'seran. Caer'valan</p> <p>You mutter at the cursed man. \"Foods gone, come back tomorrow. Out before I have to give you a lesson.\"</p> <p>The man stops, dropping his robe. Exposing bloodied runes carved into flesh. They litter the mans body. From head to toe and they glow in a subtle but burning blue flame. He lifts his head and spits the words.</p> <p>\u201cSael\u2019tharan vel Siraen.\u201d</p> <p>Blue fire explodes enveloping you. All you feel is heat...</p> <p>BRAWN! BRAWN! BRAWN!  The cheering suddenly changes, become more urgent. Then a rolling feeling as your celebratory litter topples over. You bang your head hard on the chair leg.  BRAWN get up! Varka is shaking you. Word coming in that the elves are revolting. This is bad. Some how they are organised. People say explosions at the Distribution Centre. Humans Overseers and Ork shopkeepers being strung up and mutilated near the Tattered Loom and the elves've overrun the Weeping Veins. You have to go see if you can sort it out. This could cause the Pact to wipe them out....or who knows. You should go see Veylith....maybe he can still be reasoned with. Hopefully the honor Hrimgaldr bestowed upon you is respected for another day. Maybe you all can stop this city from ripping itself apart!</p>"},{"location":"valkair/Session%20Notes/Act%201%20-%20Hammerfall/1.4.04%20-%20Siraen%20Valar/#scene-1","title":"Scene 1","text":""},{"location":"valkair/Session%20Notes/Act%201%20-%20Hammerfall/1.4.04%20-%20Siraen%20Valar/#distribution-centre-orks-save-the-orks-or-dont","title":"Distribution Centre (orks) - save the orks or don't","text":"<p>You push through a crowd of angry Elves, many carrying simple weapons.

Hammerfall's stability relies on the consistent revenue and precious metals which come from the Weeping Veins and the labor of the enslaved elves. They also rely on the magical food production and trades of the elven craftsmen in order to keep the city well fed, clothed and maintained. The Elven demands: - Elves may own and operate their own businesses within the Elven ghettos.

They expect someone else will step in.</li> <li>Pragmatic: If the war turns costly, they\u2019ll walk away.</li> <li>Ego-driven: They respect strength and reputation, not morality or pity.</li> <li>Restless: Some want a fight\u2014just a good, honorable one\u2014not endless slaughter.</li> </ul> <p>They\u2019re not stupid. If the PCs show strength and promise change (better loot, less risk, purpose), the soldiers may back off and look the other way.</p> <p>1.

No sooner was the last of those devils dispatched than these strange runes which seem to say something of commerce suddenly became dormant. Similar the treasure chest which was glimmering with gold, was revealed to be rusted iron and barnacle encrusted, the vegetables stores instantly rotten and disheveled and the shining shield dull and heavy. The temple seemed to pulsate which a moment of calm and then a thunderous eruption of water flooded the alcove sweeping us back towards that surging maelstrom in the centre of the room.

But she\u2026 she made us believe. Said the elves left us to rot \u2018cause they feared the blood that ran through her veins. Said the world itself had turned its back on strength.</p> <p>Then came the hooded one. Said he served the Fiend Below\u2014the Lord of the Depths, Osgilliath. Promised her power to break every chain, to tear down every highborn hall that cast her out. Hannah listened. She always listened when power spoke.</p> <p>We followed her beneath the old city, through catacombs older than light. There, she found her altar\u2014a black stone carved with runes that bled when touched. She cut off her own arms before we could stop her. Laughed while she did it. And when the blood hit the stone, the pit answered.</p> <p>Osgilliath filled her veins with molten fire. Her arms grew back, twisted and beautiful, claws like burning iron. She screamed, and the scream became a hymn. Hannah died on that cross, and in her place stood The Forsaken.</p> <p>She fed us at her blood after. Told us to drink if we wanted to see the world made right. I did. The pain was holy and beautiful. My skin burned, split, and healed stronger.

I led you fools through the catacombs, through the dark. Releasing her from that prison as had to be done. Her mind and soul returned to Osgilliaths service.
